I come from China, went over to, Rock Hill, SC, United States for my last 2 years of high school as an exchange student from 2013 to 2015.

Afterwards, I graduated and attended Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon. 

My major is Computer Science on web and mobile development. 
I graduated in June 2022.

I love playing video games during spare time. I play wide range of types of games, sports, FPS, MOBA, etc.

Currently I have a team named Just4Fun that consists 4 international students locating in different place including US and Canada. We are opened for more people like us who love playing games and enjoying creating contents to join us.

I am so in a self-formed group called Oregon Team WE
